# Emerging Media Final Project

> Created by: Josh Grazda and Wes Weitzman

## Goal
This project was created to immerse the player in the experience of getting onto a crowded metro.
The goal was to induce claustrophobic and paniced feelings that would resonate with someone in this
situation on the metro. We took inspiration from places exhibits at the PHI Center in Montreal, such 
as "Mind at War". 

## Tools and Software
We used a wealth of different tools and software to achieve the vision of this project. In doing so 
we were able to overcome many problems we encountered during the project and create a unique feel for
the player to experince. Some of the tools and software we used are

> Unity

> Vive / Oculus

> Amper

> Oculus Medium

> SteamVR
